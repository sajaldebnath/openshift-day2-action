# openshift-day2-action
Repository holds the vRO workflows to automate OpenShift Day2 Actions

# Purpose


Recently I was asked to explore and possibly automate the various Day2 actions of an OpenShift cluster. This document provides guidance on how to automate any Day2 actions for OpenShift Cluster using vRealize Orchestrator and ultimately offer them as XaaS services in vRealize Automation.
While this document covers only a single use case, it provides the framework, following which any and every task for OpenShift Clusters can be automated.

# What the repo provides:

The repository provides the following:
1. a vRO package (com.sajal.openshift-day2-actions.package )containing all the packages described in the guidebook. 
2. The guidebook (Automating Day2 Actions for OpenShift Clusters-A Beginners Guide-v1.0.pdf) on how to use the package and relevant workflows. But moreover on how to use the framework to automate Day 2 tasks for Red Hat OpenShift Clusters.
